One of the most famous examples of **Cellular Automata** is **Conway's Game of Life**, where the state of a grid evolves over time according to a set of rules. Each cell can be either **alive** or **dead**, and the next state of each cell depends on its neighbors.

Let me walk you through an implementation of **Conway's Game of Life** in Python:

### Rules of Conway's Game of Life:
1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies (underpopulation).
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies (overpopulation).
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell (reproduction).

### Dependencies
We will use the `numpy` library for the grid management and `matplotlib` for visualizing the evolution of the cells.

### Code

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.animation as animation

# Initialize grid size
GRID_SIZE = 50

# Define the probability of a cell being alive at the start
INITIAL_PROBABILITY = 0.2

# Define the number of generations (steps)
GENERATIONS = 200

def create_grid(size, initial_probability):
    """
    Creates a grid of given size with randomly initialized cells (alive or dead).
    Alive cells are represented as 1, dead cells as 0.
    """
    return np.random.choice([0, 1], size*size, p=[1-initial_probability, initial_probability]).reshape(size, size)

def count_alive_neighbors(grid, x, y):
    """
    Counts the number of alive neighbors of the cell at position (x, y).
    This takes into account the 8 neighboring cells (with edge wrapping).
    """
    alive_neighbors = 0
    for i in [-1, 0, 1]:
        for j in [-1, 0, 1]:
            if i == 0 and j == 0:
                continue
            alive_neighbors += grid[(x + i) % grid.shape[0], (y + j) % grid.shape[1]]
    return alive_neighbors

def next_generation(grid):
    """
    Computes the next generation of the grid based on Conway's Game of Life rules.
    """
    new_grid = grid.copy()
    for i in range(grid.shape[0]):
        for j in range(grid.shape[1]):
            alive_neighbors = count_alive_neighbors(grid, i, j)
            if grid[i, j] == 1:  # The cell is alive
                if alive_neighbors < 2 or alive_neighbors > 3:
                    new_grid[i, j] = 0  # Dies due to underpopulation or overpopulation
            else:  # The cell is dead
                if alive_neighbors == 3:
                    new_grid[i, j] = 1  # Becomes alive due to reproduction
    return new_grid

def update(frameNum, img, grid):
    """
    Update function for the animation.
    """
    new_grid = next_generation(grid)
    img.set_data(new_grid)
    grid[:] = new_grid[:]
    return img,

def main():
    # Create the initial grid
    grid = create_grid(GRID_SIZE, INITIAL_PROBABILITY)

    # Set up the figure and axis for plotting
    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    img = ax.imshow(grid, interpolation='nearest', cmap='binary')
    
    # Animate the evolution of the grid
    ani = animation.FuncAnimation(fig, update, fargs=(img, grid), frames=GENERATIONS, interval=100, save_count=50)

    plt.show()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

### How the Code Works:

1. **Grid Initialization:**
   - A grid is created with dimensions defined by `GRID_SIZE`, and each cell is randomly assigned as alive (1) or dead (0) based on the initial probability (`INITIAL_PROBABILITY`).
   
2. **Alive Neighbors Counting:**
   - The `count_alive_neighbors` function checks the 8 neighboring cells of a given cell (including wrapping around the edges) to count how many are alive.

3. **Next Generation Calculation:**
   - The `next_generation` function applies the Game of Life rules to determine the state of each cell in the next generation based on the number of alive neighbors.

4. **Animation:**
   - The `update` function is used by `matplotlib`'s `FuncAnimation` to update the grid in each frame. It updates the state of the grid over several generations and displays the evolving pattern in real-time.

### Running the Code:
1. Install the required libraries if you don't have them:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy matplotlib
   ```
2. Run the script, and you will see the evolving pattern of cells being displayed in a window.

### Customizations:
- **GRID_SIZE**: Change the size of the grid to make it larger or smaller.
- **INITIAL_PROBABILITY**: Vary the probability of initial alive cells to see different initial conditions.
- **GENERATIONS**: Define how many generations you want to simulate.

### Example of What You’ll See:
When you run this code, you’ll observe patterns like gliders, blinkers, still lifes, and other structures forming and moving across the grid based on the rules of the Game of Life. Over time, certain patterns will stabilize, while others may continue to oscillate or move.
